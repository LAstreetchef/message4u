You are an expert full-stack engineer. Build a production-ready web app called **"Booty Call"** that runs completely inside Replit.

Goal:
A sender can create a paywalled message. The recipient only sees and unlocks the message AFTER paying a fee set by the sender. The actual message content is displayed as an IMAGE (not plain text) once unlocked.

Tech stack (please use these unless impossible):
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: React (Vite or similar SPA setup)
- Database: SQLite via Prisma ORM
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Payments: Stripe (test mode is fine)
- Auth: Simple email/password auth with sessions or JWT

Overall aesthetic:
- Visual style: **cute cartoon, playful, colorful, and inclusive**.
- Avoid stereotypes tied to any specific ethnicity; instead use a **global / multicultural vibe**:
  - Friendly, rounded illustrations of diverse characters (different skin tones, hair textures, body types).
  - Hand-drawn / doodle elements (stars, hearts, squiggles, speech bubbles).
- Think “cute messaging app + little comic-book / sticker aesthetic”:
  - Soft rounded corners, pill-shaped buttons.
  - Slightly chunky, fun typography for headings, clean sans-serif for body text.
- Color palette:
  - Warm and inviting: corals, peaches, soft purples, teal accents, and cream backgrounds.
  - Use gradients sparingly for hero sections or important buttons (like “Pay to Unlock”).
- Icons:
  - Use a simple logo—e.g. a small cartoon phone with a speech bubble and a subtle heart.
  - Use emoji and small icons (💌 📱 💖) in headings and buttons where appropriate.
- Keep the whole UI **mobile-first** and thumb-friendly.

High-level behavior:
1. **User roles**
   - A normal user account acts as a “sender” by default.
   - The recipient does NOT need an account to pay and view a single message; they only need the unique link.

2. **Auth & onboarding**
   - Create email/password sign up and login pages.
   - Protect the sender dashboard with auth.
   - Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Style these pages with the cute cartoon vibe:
     - Illustrated hero area on the right (or top on mobile) with a diverse, cartoon couple or friends texting.
     - Fun heading like “Welcome to Booty Call 💌” and “Slide into the paywall.”

3. **Create a paywalled message**
   - Sender logs in and can create a new “Booty Call” message with:
     - `recipientIdentifier`: freeform text field (could be a name, phone, or email; just store it as a string).
     - `title` or `short label` for the message.
     - `messageBody`: the full text the sender wants to send.
     - `price`: a numeric field (e.g., USD).
   - UI for this should:
     - Be in a cute card with doodle borders.
     - Use helper text and maybe emojis (e.g. “How much should they pay to open this? 💸”).
   - When the sender clicks “Create,” the backend should:
     - Store a record in the database.
     - Generate a unique, hard-to-guess slug (e.g. UUID) that becomes the message’s public URL: `/m/:slug`.

4. **Text must be a picture**
   - The messageBody MUST NOT be shown as plain text to the recipient after payment. Instead, render it as an image.
   - Implement a simple text-to-image flow:
     - Option A (preferred): On the backend, use a Node library (like `node-canvas` or similar) to render `messageBody` into a PNG image and save it to disk or store a base64 string in the DB.
     - Option B: On the frontend, use an HTML `<canvas>` to render `messageBody` into an image, send the PNG to the backend, and store it.
   - In the rendering, use:
     - A playful, rounded font.
     - A soft background color (e.g., peach or light cream).
     - Optional doodles (heart, star) in the corners.
   - Store the image URL/path in the database.
   - For security, never expose the raw text in the frontend once the message has been created.

5. **Public message page (paywall)**
   - Route: `GET /m/:slug`
   - Before payment, this page should show:
     - Branding header with the Booty Call logo and a cute tagline.
     - Message title or label.
     - Price to unlock.
     - Text like: “Pay to unlock this secret message 👀”.
     - A “Pay to Unlock” button that triggers Stripe Checkout (or a simple Stripe payment flow).
   - The message IMAGE should NOT be visible before payment.
     - Show a blurred or pixelated placeholder card with a little lock icon and text like “Locked”.
   - Style this page with:
     - A large illustration of a phone with a lock and hearts.
     - Confetti or sparkles around the “Pay to Unlock” button.

6. **Payment flow**
   - Integrate Stripe in test mode.
   - When the recipient clicks “Pay to Unlock,” create a Stripe Checkout Session with the specified price.
   - After successful payment, redirect to a “success/unlock” route, e.g. `/m/:slug/unlocked`.
   - On webhook or callback from Stripe (simplify as needed for Replit), store in the database that this slug has been paid for at least once.
   - You can treat payment as “global unlock” (anyone with the link can see it once paid) to simplify – no need to tie it to a specific user.

7. **Unlocked view**
   - When the message has a successful payment recorded:
     - The `/m/:slug` or `/m/:slug/unlocked` page should:
       - Check the DB for “paid/unlocked” status.
       - If unlocked, load and display the messageBody IMAGE at full quality (no blur).
       - Do NOT send the raw text to the frontend.
   - Add a cute animation (like a small scale/fade-in) when the image appears.
   - Optionally show little celebratory elements like confetti or animated sparkles.

8. **Sender dashboard**
   - Authenticated sender dashboard route: e.g. `/dashboard`
   - Show:
     - List of all messages created by the logged-in user.
     - For each message: title, price, createdAt, status (Unlocked or Not Unlocked), and the public link `/m/:slug`.
   - UI styling:
     - Display messages as fun cards with small icons (💌, 🔒, 💸).
     - Use badges with colors indicating status (e.g. grey “Locked”, green “Unlocked”).
   - Allow senders to:
     - Copy the public URL.
     - Optionally mark a message as “inactive” so new payments are disabled (button: “Deactivate message”).

9. **Database schema (Prisma example)**
   - `User`:
     - id
     - email (unique)
     - passwordHash
     - createdAt
   - `Message`:
     - id
     - slug (unique)
     - userId (FK to User)
     - title
     - recipientIdentifier
     - price (integer or decimal)
     - imageUrl or imageData
     - unlocked (boolean, default false)
     - createdAt
   - `Payment` (optional but nice):
     - id
     - messageId
     - stripeSessionId
     - amount
     - createdAt

10. **Security & UX details**
    - Make sure API routes are protected: only the owner of a message can see it in the dashboard.
    - Public route `/m/:slug` should never leak the raw messageBody text.
    - Basic input validation for price and message text length.
    - Show user-friendly error messages for missing/invalid slugs and failed payments, styled in the same cute cartoon aesthetic.

11. **Project structure**
    - Provide a clear README with:
      - How to run the app on Replit.
      - Environment variables needed (Stripe keys, JWT secret, etc.).
    - Add scripts in `package.json` for:
      - `dev` (start backend + frontend, or a single dev server if using a monorepo or proxy)
      - `prisma migrate dev` or similar
    - Include example `.env.example` file.

12. **Branding**
    - App name **“Booty Call”** should be visible in the navbar and on all main pages.
    - Include a small footer note like: “Booty Call – pay-to-open messages with cute cartoon flavor 💕”.
    - Ensure the tone is playful but not explicit: keep it fun, flirty, and light-hearted.

Please generate:
- All necessary backend and frontend code.
- Prisma schema and migration commands for SQLite.
- Stripe integration in test mode.
- Instructions in the README so that this app can be run on Replit with minimal setup.
